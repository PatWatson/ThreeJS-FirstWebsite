        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Patrick Watson Design offers three services: Logo Design, Brand Identity Design, Web Development. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The agency was founded by Patrick Watson, a graphic design student at Humber College in Toronto. Prior to design, he studied at Queenâ€™s University in Kingston, graduating with a degree in Computer Engineering and worked at a large tech company.

        </p>

        <p>
          With his Graphic Design Certificate and borrowing from his experience working in tech, Patrick takes an agile approach to each design project. The result is an efficient, iterative workflow that produces effective, innovative logos, brand identities and websites reflective of your companyâ€™s unique Customer Value Proposition.

        <h2>Approach</h2>

        <p>
          PWD follows an 8 step design process:

        </p>
        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Step 1: Project Brief</h2>
          A project brief is a document outlining information such as target audience, specifications, project theme and tone. This is where the client's design problem is defined.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->

        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Step 2: Research</h2>
          A research document outlines the client's brand and product history, current and past competitors, client industry information.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->

        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Step 3: Mood Board</h2>
          A moodboard showcases a collection of visual elements including colour schemes, relevant imagery, graphics, and typography.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->

        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Step 4: Ideation</h2>
          The SCAMPER brainstorming method is used to generate 10 concept ideas.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->

        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Step 5: Concept Work</h2>
          Two to three concept ideas from the Ideation step are further developed into five variations each.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->

        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Step 6: Concept Development</h2>
          The best variation of each concept idea is developed digitally using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign and Adobe XD. This is where grey-scale, vectorized logos are generated.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->

        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Step 7: Concept Presentation</h2>
          The two to three digital concepts are presented to the client where one is selected as the final concept.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->

        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Step 8: Concept Revisions</h2>
          The final concept goes through revisions based on the client's critical feedback.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->

        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          <h2>Final Design</h2>
          The final design is handed off to the client in all formats needed along with all necessary documentation such as brand identity guidelines.
        </p> <!-- Paragraph closing tag -->
        <p> <!-- Paragraph opening tag -->
          A successful logo and brand identity system is simple, distinct, and appropriately conveys your companyâ€™s Unique Selling Point to your target audience.
